    "The large required load coupled with the very small allowable deflection results in a tall beam with a height of around 0.43 meters. This would result in a very heavy beam, and if a CNC gantry is to be used to position the structure, this would require a stiffer and thus more expensive gantry system. In order to save material, it may be better to use an I-beam or a more complicated truss structure with a larger portion of it's material positioned as far away from the neutral bending axis as possible, resulting in a lighter structure for the same stiffness."

    "First and foremost, in order for the stringer to adequately comply with the fuselage curvature,the plate must deform in the plastic region such that the stringer does not spring back into the original shape. The applied stress limit would be the ultimate tensile strength but in order to prevent mechanical failure, an acceptable safety factor must be applied. In view of this, one will be able to deduce the corresponding minimal fuselage radius, namely the maximal curvature that guarantees a reliable and safe operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feasibility of successfully deforming a stiffener depends on a variety of interdependent factors. Material properties (such as strength, ductility and toughness) define the limits for plastic deformation without fracture. Geometry (such as thickness, width, length and cross-sectional shape) affects bending stiffness and applied strain. The substrate, in this case the curved fuselage, determines the needed force and deformation for adequate stiffener compliance. Tooling and press conditions (such as force capacity, contact surface and friction) influence the accuracy of the forming. Manufacturing variables (deformation rate, temperature and safety factor) influence the practical limits of the forming process."

    "A higher cooling rate diminishes the degree of crystallinity, which is favourable in the case of manufacturing of thermoplastic composites. A low-crystallized thermoplastic introduces waviness and roughness to the surface, which actually promotes mechanical interlocking between the laminates in terms of the corresponding bonding and shear strength. However, as the thermoplastic cools down too rapidly, the entrapped air has less time to escape leading to a higher void content, which is indeed undesired. This ultimately means, that there is a trade-off exists between the crystallinity and void content.\n",

    "The conservative assumptions made in the calculations imply that there is heat being exclusively transferred within the boundaries of a heated spot on the thermoplastic prepeg and underlying tool. All other heat transfer is neglected, which creates an unrealistic scenario that is both positive and negative at the same time.\n",
    "It is favourable, since the heating time to reach 400°C would be lower, given, since no heat is lost to the air or surrounding material, namely all the heat goes into raising the temperature of the thermoplastic and the tool underneath. So no energy is wasted, which is economically more viable for the manufacturer.\n",
    "The adverse aspect of the assumptions raises during the cooling phase, since there is no conduction possible to surrounding areas and no convection/radiation to air, which results in a cooling process that is much slower. This means that the crystallization time is extended, which (as previously discussed) would be undesirable as it jeopardizes the effectiveness of the entire manufacturing process. tst\n",
